I'm a social social scientist in the literal sense of the word. On the one hand, I have a strong analytic mind which I like to use to critically question everything. This explains my passion for the field of Statistics. At the same time, I love working together in a team and I'd like my work to have a tangible positive impact on peoples' life. I'm striving for a function within a diverse organization in which I can make full use of these two sides of me. Within the field of Statistics, my areas of expertise include, but are not limited to, Bayesian Statistics, Structural Equation Modeling, Machine Learning and Regularization. My strong soft skills make me a particularly suited candidate for a role in which the communication of statistical results to a less technically versed audience is central.
