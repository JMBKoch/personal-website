     As a teaching assistant, I teach work groups and practicals in a variety of statistical courses for students in the social sciences. Passing on knowledge on statistics and research methodology to a less technically versed audience is a great passion of mine.

     JASP is a free and open source statistical software package, aimed at making advanced statistical techniques accessible to a broad academic audience. I maintained the Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) module. Other tasks included writing [tutorials](https://jasp-stats.org/2022/01/25/measurement-invariance-testing-using-the-structural-equation-modeling-sem-module-in-jasp/) and answering user questions.
